  was set or they are `conf` packages

* Now based on opam 2 libs and intended for publications in the 2.0 format
  (inclusive opam files, etc.)
* Bumped version number to avoid confusion with opam versions
* Removed the two-step operation ("prepare" and "publish"). A single invocation
  does all

  specified directly on the command-line, and repeated for multiple
  publications
